# Cadency-rs

A discord bot written in **Rust** with the help of [serenity](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity) and [songbird](https://github.com/serenity-rs/songbird).
Initially this was intended to be a rust clone of [my typescript discord bot](https://github.com/jontze/Cadency) but currently **Cadency-rs** offers more features and is more up to date as it's already using the discord **slash commands**.

## Installation

The recommended way to install and run **Cadency-rs** is with docker, as the docker image installs several libraries and binaries that are required to use or build the bot.

1. Pull the image from the **ghcr.io** registry (`main` pulls the latest stable build, `develop` latest development build or `vX.X.X` pulls a fix version)

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/jontze/cadency_rs:main
```

2. Start a container and pass your discord bot token to the container by setting the `DISCORD_TOKEN` environment variable and optional specify the log level e.g. `RUST_LOG="cadency=info"`.
3. Invite the bot to your discord server, discord offers a great [documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started) how to do this

## Example docker commands:

First run. replace TOKEN_HERE with your bot token:

```sh
docker run --name cadency_rs -e DISCORD_TOKEN=TOKEN_HERE ghcr.io/jontze/cadency_rs:main
```

Subsequent runs:

```sh
docker start -a cadency_rs
```

Do remember to remove the container and rerun the first command after an update.
